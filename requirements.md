# CardSaathi – Requirements Document

## 1. Project Overview
CardSaathi is a smart financial assistant platform that helps users manage multiple credit/debit cards and intelligently suggests the best card to use for each transaction to maximize cashback, rewards, and benefits.

---

## 2. Problem Statement
Many users own multiple cards but:
- Do not know which card gives maximum rewards for a specific category.
- Fail to track reward points efficiently.
- Miss bill due dates.
- Miss special offers and cashback opportunities.
- Lack personalized financial insights.

Existing banking apps only show transactions and balances but do not optimize card usage.

## 3. How CardSaathi is Different from Existing Solutions

Current real-time solutions (like banking apps, reward trackers, or expense apps):

- Only show spending history.
- Do not compare multiple cards.
- Do not suggest the best card before making a purchase.
- Do not calculate reward optimization.
- Work independently per bank (not centralized).

### CardSaathi Differentiation:

✔ Centralized platform for multiple cards from different banks  
✔ Real-time best card recommendation before transaction  
✔ Category-wise reward optimization  
✔ Smart reward comparison algorithm  
✔ Personalized insights based on spending patterns  
✔ Bill reminders + reward expiry alerts  
✔ AI-based future enhancement for predictive recommendations  

CardSaathi acts as a proactive financial companion, not just a tracker.
